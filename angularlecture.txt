To understand the capabilities of the Angular framework, you need to learn about the following:

Components
Templates
Directives
Dependency injection

Sharing data between child and parent directives and components
---------------------------------------------------------------
@Input() and @Output() give a child component a way to communicate with its parent component. 
@Input() lets a parent component update data in the child component. Conversely,
 @Output() lets the child send data to a parent component.



let age:number;
let n:string;
let isPrime:boolean;
let batch:{}
let book:{
    name:string,
    price:number
}
b:book={
    name:"b1",
    price:120
};
b1:book={
    author:"a1"
}

/*
